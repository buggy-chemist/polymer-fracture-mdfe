Each subfolder contains the initial data files in "input_files/", the parameter file in "input_parameters/" and a job submission script "job.sh". 

The initial data files include the FE mesh "FE.inp", the MD data "MD.data" and the position of the anchor points "MD.ac".

The coupled simulations were run in their corresponding subfolders by submitting "job.sh" in Slurm Batch system through "sbatch job.sh".

The latest version of the code for the coupled simulations can be downloaded in Zenodo. (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.10423465)

The version of the code used for this publication will be made available on request by Email to wuyang.zhao@fau.de.
