The "manager.sh" script sets up pure MD simulations for provided initial system data file "cgps_chec_cooled.data" in the seed folders. These MD simulations will have varying bond breaking thresholds and loading conditions as described in the paper.

"pairs.dat", "bonds.dat", and "angles.dat" are the tabulated potentials governing our polystyrene model.

"PS_equil_orig_ld.in", "PS_equil_orig_yz.in" are the lammps simulation scripts for the 2 different loading conditions. These are used as a template by the manager script.

"analysis_plot.ipynb" is a python notebook that reads in simulation data and post processes it to perform various different calculations. The plots in the paper were generated within this notebook.
